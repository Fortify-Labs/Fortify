## Overview

This project is a big data processing platform, that is aggregating and processing Dota Underlord's game state integration logs in order to extract live information from matches and collect stats from played matches.

## Getting started

### Local Setup

All necessary containers to for a development environment can be pulled & started using `docker-compose up -d`.

### Starting already build images

This can be done, using the following commands:

- Pulling all images

  ```bash
