## Overview

This project aims to develop a platform, that is aggregating and processing game state integration logs in order to extract live information from matches and collect stats from played matches.

## Getting started

### Local Setup

All necessary databases and systems can be started using `docker-compose up -d`.

The corresponding microservices are located in the `services/` directory.
Those can be started locally by navigating into the service's directory and running `npm run dev`. (Each microservice will have a dedicated Readme explaining necessary setup steps.)

### Kubernetes Setup
